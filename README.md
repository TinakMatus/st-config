# st - simple terminal

This is my personal build of st. I switched to this because most modern terminals are bloated with features I never use.

# How it works

I used the Suckless framework to keep the terminal as fast as possible. Since it doesnt have a bloated config file I have modified the C source code directly to add the features I need for my daily workflow.

* The Code: I merged several community patches into the core C source to handle things that the base version lacks like a scrollback buffer and font ligatures.

* The Logic: I have integrated it with my systemwide theme. By using the Xresources patch the terminal automatically picks up the colors generated by pywal.

* The Result: A high performance terminal that opens instantly uses very little memory and looks exactly the way I want it to.

# Modern Look (Starship)

I use the Starship prompt because it gives the terminal a much more modern look with clean colors and icons. It is also very useful for my workflow since it helps me see exactly what directory I'm in and my current Git status at a glance.

# My Applied Patches

These are the modifications I have added to the source:

* [**alpha**](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/) - Adds transparency support.
* [**anysize**](https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/) - Fixes the window resizing logic.
* [**scrollback**](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) - Allows me to scroll through my terminal history using the keyboard.
* [**ligatures**](https://st.suckless.org/patches/ligatures/) - Support for programming fonts like JetBrains Mono so code looks cleaner.
* [**xresources**](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/) - Lets the terminal read its color palette from the system memory (xrdb).

"Simple, fast, and stays out of the way."
